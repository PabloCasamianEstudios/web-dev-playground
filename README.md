# web-dev-playground
A collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript experiments and practice projects. This repository serves as a sandbox where I test new concepts, try out different designs, and experiment with web development techniques. It's a place to explore front-end development, prototype user interfaces, and refine coding skills.
